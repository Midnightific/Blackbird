## [View the repository!](https://github.com/Midnightific/Blackbird)

Blackbird is a simple library loader for Roblox. I know, *another* library loader? I know the feeling, trust me. But don't pass us by just yet! We've got a ton of in-built libraries, features and much more coming soon! Some of these include: memorizing module paths, dedicated events, init & start module loading, and much, much more!

## Installation

There is currently only one way to install blackbird but more are on the way!

### Installing via copy and paste
You can also copy and paste the files you want into your project repository or studio. However, the more libraries/modules you want to copy, the more time it's going to take, it becomes less ergonomic in the end this way. But don't let that discourage you, you copy and pasters!

*More to come soon.*
